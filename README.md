# BrainGonadTradeoff

# Overview

This repository contains the data and analysis code for the manuscript "Male reproductive tactics drive correlated selection for large gonads with small brains." This study examines the relationship between brain and gonad size in _Poecilia parae_ and related species to determine whether negative correlations arise from energetic trade-offs or correlated selection. The findings suggest that reproductive strategies shape brain evolution through correlated selection rather than direct resource allocation constraints, challenging traditional assumptions about sexual selectionâ€™s impact on brain size.

# Repository Contents

TissueInvestment_R_Code.R: R script for performing statistical analyses on the dataset.

TissueInvestmentData.csv: Contains raw data used in the statsical analysis, including:
  Body size (length and weight), Brain weight, Male Gonad weight, and Neuron/glia ratio

Brain_Cell_Counts.xlsx: Excel file used to compute the neuron/glia ratio, consisting of three sheets:
  Total Cells: Raw cell counts (Number of DAPI stained cells across 10 aliquots)
  Filtered Total Cells: Processed cell counts after filtering to havea coefficient of vairation (CV) below 0.10
  Neuron/Glia Ratio Count: Neuron/glia ratio calculations (Number of cells stained with GFP and DAPI divided by number of cells that only stained DAPI)
